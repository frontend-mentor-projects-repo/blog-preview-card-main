## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project is subsequent project to the brush-up [project](https://github.com/frontend-mentor-projects-repo/qr-code-component-main), which solidifies my understanding of using Flexbox.

I learned 
- to use `border`
- to use `box-shadow`
- to style common elements simultaneously
- to import and use custom font family 

After this project, I became more familiar and comfortable of using Flexbox.
